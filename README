First commit, much excitement…..

NOTE:
the commits are not instantaneous

- to go into a specific folder, just drag the folder holding the repository to the command prompt

- Add files by calling git add <filename>

- then commit these files by calling git commit
then git push origin master, this updates the git

- if master is not established yet call git remote add origin <website>

- git commit -m “Message” will give your commit a message to tell the team what you changed
